# Heart Disease Prediction

## Purpose
According to the Mayo Clinic, heart disease can discribe several condition with the heart.  Some of these conditions are coronary 
artery disease (CAD), irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), birth defects (congenital heart defects), disease of the heart muscle, 
or heart valve disease.  Some of the contributing factors of heart disease are cholesterol deposits (plaques) in the arteries.  These
plaques build up and block the blood flow from the heart.  Some of the symtoms of heart disease can be:
 *  Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)
 *  Shortness of breath
 *  Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly area or back
 *  Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in the effect areas are narrowed.

## Research Question(s)
1. Does the age of the patient contribute to a of a heart attack?
2. Does the level of blood sugar (FBS) in the patient contribute to a heart attack?
3. Does a higher cholestoral level contribute to a heart attack?

## Data Source
Data files were sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.   The sata files were coverted to csv files and cleaned before analysis.
